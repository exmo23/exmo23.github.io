    <h2>Fermentation Update</h2>
    <p>Currently I have a Chimay clone in secondary fermentation. It should turn out around 6% ABV when the secondary is done in a week or so.</p>
    <h2>Next Up</h2>
    <p>My next ferment is undecided right now. I'm thinking about making a pear cider for fall.</p>
